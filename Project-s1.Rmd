## Data  from PROUNI

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see 

```{r cars}
df<-read.csv("data/prouni_2005_2019.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
head(df)


library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
df %>%
   group_by(ANO_CONCESSAO_BOLSA,SEXO_BENEFICIARIO_BOLSA)%>%
  summarize(n())
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(dygraphs)
library(xts) # To make the convertion data-frame / xts format

# Format 3: Several variables for each date



# Then you can create the xts format:
don=xts( x=df[,-1], order.by=as.Date(as.yearmon(df$ANO_CONCESSAO_BOLSA)))

# Chart
p <- dygraph(don)
p

```
